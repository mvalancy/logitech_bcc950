"""Sensorium — Amy's L3 AWARENESS layer.

Fuses data from all sensor threads (YOLO, deep vision, audio, motor,
thinking) into a temporal narrative that higher layers can read.

This is a passive data structure — no thread of its own.  Other threads
push events in, and the thinking thread reads the narrative out.

Usage::

    from .sensorium import Sensorium
    s = Sensorium()
    s.push("yolo", "1 person entered from left", importance=0.8)
    s.push("audio", "Speech detected")
    print(s.narrative())
